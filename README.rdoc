= serializable_proc

As the name suggests, SerializableProc is a proc that can be serialized (marshalled).
A proc is a closure, which consists of the code block defining it, and binding of
local variables. SerializableProc's approach to serializability is to extract:

1. the code from the proc (using sourcify), and
2. the local, instance, class & global variables reference within the proc from the
   proc's binding, using deep copy via Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(var))

A SerializableProc differs from the vanilla Proc in the following 2 ways:

=== 1. Isolated variables

By default, upon initializing, all variables (local, instance, class & global) within its
context are extracted from the proc's binding, and are isolated from changes outside the
proc's scope, thus, achieving a snapshot effect.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'serializable_proc'

  x, @x, @@x, $x = 'lx', 'ix', 'cx', 'gx'

  s_proc = SerializableProc.new { [x, @x, @@x, $x].join(', ') }
  v_proc = Proc.new { [x, @x, @@x, $x].join(', ') }

  x, @x, @@x, $x = 'ly', 'iy', 'cy', 'gy'

  s_proc.call # >> "lx, ix, cx, gx"
  v_proc.call # >> "ly, iy, cy, gy"

Sometimes, we may want global variables to behave as truly global, meaning we don't want
to isolate globals at all, this can be done by specifying :ignore option in the constructor call:

  s_proc = SerializableProc.new(ignore: :global) do
    $stdout << "WakeUp !!"         # $stdout is the $stdout in the execution context
  end

Supported values are :global, :class, :instance, :local & :all, with :all overriding
all others. The following declares all variables as not isolatable:

  s_proc = SerializableProc.new(ignore: :all) do
    ...
  end

You can also set :isolate option explicitly in the constructor to specify which variable types should be isolated. The supported values as same as for the :ignore option. The following will isolate only locals:

  s_proc = SerializableProc.new(isolate: :local) do
    ...
  end

Note that the :ignore option will be processed on top of the :isolate option. The following will isolate only locals:

  s_proc = SerializableProc.new(isolate: :all, ignore: [:global, :class, :instance]) do
    ...
  end

When invoking, Kernel.binding should be passed in to avoid unpleasant surprises:

  s_proc.call(binding)

(take a look at SerializableProc's rdoc for more details)

=== 2. Marshallable

No throwing of TypeError when marshalling a SerializableProc:

  Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(s_proc)).call # >> "lx, ix, cx, gx"
  Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(v_proc)).call # >> TypeError (cannot dump Proc)

== Installing It

The religiously standard way:

  $ gem install serializable_proc

== Gotchas

Under the hood, SerializableProc relies on sourcify[http://github.com/ngty/sourcify] to
do code extraction, thus it shares the same gotchas as sourcify.

== Supported Rubies

SerializableProc has been tested to work on the following rubies:

1. MRI 1.8.6, 1.8.7 & 1.9.1
2. REE 1.8.7
2. JRuby 1.5.1+

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by
  itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
